# semantic_cartography

An exploration of semantic cartography.

This repository stores a number of projects which introduce various
concepts from semantic cartography.

Large Language Models and other systems which provide *embeddings*
place semantics in a large dimensional space as a *vector*. These
vectors are designed to be close together when they are semantically
related.
